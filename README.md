# Calculator Project

This calculator was made in Python. To use it, you need:

- Python installed
- The Colorama library installed
- A text editor to open and edit the scripts
- A terminal to run and test the program

Remember, this is just a **tutorial on how to create a calculator**.  
I also included the scripts so you can better understand how it works.

The project is **modifiable**, so you can customize:

- The GUI
- The internal code
- Additional operations

Think of it as a **base to build upon**.
